# Server Setup

This is my personal way to get a fresh server up and running in minutes.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/berupor/Server_setup.git
cd server-setup
cp config.sh.example config.sh   # edit USERNAME, SSH_PORT, etc.
task                              # runs all setup steps
